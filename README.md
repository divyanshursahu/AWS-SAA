## **AWS Regions**

- AWS has regions all around the world
- Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3...
- A region is a cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region scoped(if you use the same service in two different regions, you will be charged twice)

## **How to choose an AWS Region ?**

If you need to launch a new application, where should you do it? 

<img src ="assets/which region to choose.png" width="70%" height="" style="display: block; margin: 10 auto">

- [Compliance]() with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- [Proximity]() to customers: reduced latency
- [Available services]() within a Region: new services
and new features arenâ€™t available in every Region
- [Pricing:]() pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.

## **AWS Availability Zones**

- Each region has many availablility zones(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
  - ap-southeast-2a
  - ap-southeast-2b
  - ap-southeast-2c

- Each availability zone(AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundanct power, networking, and connectivity)
- They're separate from each other,so that the're isolated from disasters
- They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
