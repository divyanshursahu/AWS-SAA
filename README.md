- [Compliance]() with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- [Proximity]() to customers: reduced latency
- [Available services]() within a Region: new services
and new features arenâ€™t available in every Region
- [Pricing:]() pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
